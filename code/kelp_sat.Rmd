## Read in the dataset from: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=74.

## This is time series data of kelp canopy using satellite imagery and will be updated regularly. The file is a .ns so we use the 'ncdf4' package. 

## HELP: Need to read this direct off web

#nc_kelp_raw <- nc_open(here('data', 'LandsatkelpBiomass_2021_v2_withmetadata.nc'))

## Not sure how to create this data frame, but these are the variables we need. 

#station <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "station")
#lon <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "longitude")
#lat <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "latitude")
#year <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "year")
#quarter <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "quarter")

## This is the main variable we want
#biomass <- ncvar_get(nc_kelp_raw, "biomass")


```

```{r}
# Placeholder map data until .ns can be figured out 

# This is the kelp biomass from all sites, will bind the coordinates for the sites after 

kelp_raw_sites <- read_csv(here('data', 'kelp_no3_waves.csv'))

sites <- read_csv(here('data', 'site_locations.csv'))

combined_kelp <- merge(sites, kelp_raw_sites, by = "site_id")

# This worked! We now have a proxy for kelp biomass by site including coordinates. 
```

```{r}
# Now we want to map this kelp across the sites using the 'sf' package 

#First filter for jsut the SB coordiantes:

combined_kelp_sb <- combined_kelp %>% 
  filter(site_id %in% c(267:298)) %>% 
  group_by(site_id)

kelp_sb_sf <- combined_kelp_sb %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c('lon', 'lat'))

# we need to tell R what the coordinate reference system is 

st_crs(kelp_sb_sf) <- 4326

ggplot(data = kelp_sb_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = 'darkgreen') +
  theme_minimal()

# Reading in the coastal polygon shp file for SB from here: http://geodata.library.ucsb.edu/catalog/3853-s3_2002_s3_reg_coastal 

sb_map <- read_sf(here('data', 'coastal_map',
                       '3853-s3_2004_s3_coastal_zone.shp'))

sb_map_transform <- st_transform(sb_map, 4326)

ggplot(data = sb_map_transform) +
  geom_sf()

# Kick ass, we have the coastal zone shp file now. Note: this is for the entire county so we may need to filter it somehow or jsut include more kelp sites. 

# Now make a combined plot with all the data:

sb_map_static <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sb_map,
          size = .1,
          color = 'darkgrey') +
  geom_sf(data = kelp_sb_sf,
          size = .5,
          color = 'red') +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = 'Kelp Cover in Santa Barbara')

# Using tmap from the lab

tmap_mode('view') 
tmap_kelp <- tm_shape(kelp_sb_sf) +
  tm_dots()

tmap_kelp

# THIS IS A FUNCTIONAL MAP FEATURE!!! 

# NEXT THING TO FIGURE OUT: LOADING NS, CREATING WEIGHTINGS/COLOR BASED ON KELP DENSITY AND INCLUDING TIME SERIES FILTER
