## Read in the dataset from: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=74.

## This is time series data of kelp canopy using satellite imagery and will be updated regularly. The file is a .ns so we use the 'ncdf4' package. 

## HELP: Need to read this direct off web
